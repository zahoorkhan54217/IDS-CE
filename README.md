# Data Science
Data science is a multidisciplinary field that combines elements of statistics, mathematics, computer science, and domain knowledge to extract insights and knowledge from data. It involves using various techniques, such as machine learning, data mining, and predictive analytics, to analyze and interpret large and complex data sets.

Data science can be applied in a wide range of domains, including business, healthcare, finance, social sciences, and more. Some of the common tasks performed by data scientists include data cleansing and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building and validation, and communicating insights to stakeholders.

With the increasing availability of data and computing power, data science has become an essential tool for businesses and organizations to gain a competitive edge and make informed decisions. It is also an exciting and rapidly evolving field with many career opportunities.

## Importance of Data Science

Importance of data science in today's world:

◦ The amount of data being generated is growing exponentially.

◦ Data science provides valuable insights that can be used to drive innovation, improve processes, and 
make informed decisions.

# Python Basics
Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language that is widely used in many fields, including data science, machine learning, web development, and scientific computing. It was created by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s and named after the Monty Python comedy group.

## 1 Variables: 
Variables are used to store data. In Python, you can declare a variable and assign a value to it like this:

x = 10

name = "Zahoor"

## 2 Print statement: 
The print() function is used to display output to the console. You can print a variable or a string literal like this:

print(x)

print("Hello, world!")

## 3 Basic operations: 
Python supports basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. Here are some examples:

a = 5

b = 3

print(a + b)   # Output: 8

print(a - b)   # Output: 2

print(a * b)   # Output: 15

print(a / b)   # Output: 1.6666666666666667

print(a % b)   # Output: 2

## 4 Conditional statements: 
Conditional statements are used to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. In Python, you can use the if-else statement like this:

age = 20

if age >= 18:

    print("You are an adult.")
    
else:

    print("You are a minor.")
    
## 5 Loops: 
Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. Python has two types of loops: 'for' and 'while'. Here are some examples:

#### for loop

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]

for fruit in fruits:

    print(fruit)

#### while loop

i = 1

while i <= 5:

    print(i)
    
    i += 1
